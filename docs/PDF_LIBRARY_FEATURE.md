# 📚 PDF Library Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This feature enables **topic-based PDF naming** and a **centralized dashboard** where users can view, download, and manage all their generated research papers.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Model (Prisma)**
- Added `Paper` model to track all generated PDFs
- Fields: `id`, `userId`, `filename`, `title`, `supabasePath`, `fileSize`, `createdAt`
- Automatic relationship with `User` model
- Migration created: `20251002112300_add_paper_model`

**File:** `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

---

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints (Express)**

#### `POST /api/research/papers/metadata` (Internal)
- Called by FastAPI after PDF generation
- Saves paper metadata to database
- Auto-creates user if doesn't exist
- Protected by `x-internal-request` header

#### `GET /api/research/papers/library` (Protected)
- Returns all papers for authenticated user
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Requires Clerk authentication

#### `DELETE /api/research/papers/:id` (Protected)
- Deletes paper from database
- Verifies user ownership before deletion
- Returns success/error response

**File:** `backend/index.ts` (lines 763-893)

---

### 3. **PDF Generation Updates (FastAPI)**

#### Enhanced `render_latex_pdf()` Tool
- Added `topic` parameter for naming PDFs
- Sanitizes topic to create safe filenames
- Format: `{topic}_{timestamp}.pdf`
- Fallback to `paper_{timestamp}.pdf` if no topic

#### Automatic Metadata Saving
- After PDF generation, calls backend API
- Sends: `user_id`, `filename`, `title`, `supabase_path`, `file_size`
- Non-blocking (failures don't prevent PDF generation)

**File:** `agent/ai-researcher/write_pdf.py`

---

### 4. **AI System Prompt Update**

Updated instructions to guide AI to:
- Extract descriptive research topics from conversations
- Always pass `topic` parameter when calling `render_latex_pdf`
- Example: `render_latex_pdf(content, topic="Quantum Computing in Machine Learning")`

**File:** `agent/ai-researcher/main.py` (lines 195-200)

---

### 5. **Frontend Dashboard Page**

Created **`/dashboard`** route with:

**Features:**
- Grid layout showing all user's research papers
- Each card displays:
  - Paper title (from topic)
  - Creation date & time
  - Filename
  - File size
  - Download button
  - Delete button with confirmation

**UI Components:**
- Loading state with spinner
- Empty state for new users
- Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)
- Hover effects and animations
- Back button to chat

**File:** `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

---

### 6. **Navigation Integration**

Added **"Library"** button to chat page navbar:
- Located next to PDF dropdown
- Always visible for easy access
- Links to `/dashboard`
- Styled consistently with app theme

**File:** `frontend/app/chat/page.tsx` (lines 658-665)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Flow: User Request → PDF Generation → Dashboard**

1. **User asks AI to generate research paper**
   ```
   User: "Write a paper on quantum computing applications"
   ```

2. **AI extracts topic and generates PDF**
   - AI identifies topic: "Quantum Computing Applications"
   - Calls: `render_latex_pdf(latex_content, topic="Quantum Computing Applications")`

3. **PDF created with topic-based name**
   ```
   Filename: Quantum_Computing_Applications_20251002_154230.pdf
   ```

4. **FastAPI uploads to Supabase**
   ```
   Path: {userId}/Quantum_Computing_Applications_20251002_154230.pdf
   ```

5. **FastAPI notifies Express backend**
   ```json
   POST /api/research/papers/metadata
   {
     "user_id": "user_abc123",
     "filename": "Quantum_Computing_Applications_20251002_154230.pdf",
     "title": "Quantum Computing Applications",
     "supabase_path": "user_abc123/Quantum_Computing_Applications_20251002_154230.pdf",
     "file_size": 245760
   }
   ```

6. **Paper saved to database**
   - Creates record in `papers` table
   - Links to user via `userId`

7. **User views in dashboard**
   - Clicks "Library" button in chat navbar
   - Sees all generated papers with titles
   - Can download or delete any paper

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### **Before:**
- ❌ PDFs named with timestamps only: `paper_20251002_154230.pdf`
- ❌ No way to see all generated papers
- ❌ Had to remember/search for PDFs in chat history
- ❌ No metadata tracking

### **After:**
- ✅ PDFs named by topic: `Quantum_Computing_Applications_20251002.pdf`
- ✅ Centralized dashboard showing all papers
- ✅ One-click access via "Library" button
- ✅ Full metadata: title, date, size
- ✅ Easy download and delete functionality
- ✅ Persistent storage in database

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All library endpoints protected by Clerk auth
   - Users can only see their own papers

2. **Ownership Verification**
   - Delete endpoint verifies paper belongs to user
   - Prevents unauthorized deletion

3. **Internal API Protection**
   - Metadata endpoint requires `x-internal-request: true` header
   - Only accessible from FastAPI server

4. **Data Isolation**
   - Papers organized by userId in Supabase
   - Database queries filtered by userId

---

## 📊 Database Schema

```prisma
model Paper {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId        String
  filename      String
  title         String
  supabasePath  String?
  fileSize      Int?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())

  user          User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([userId])
  @@map("papers")
}
```

**Relationships:**
- One User → Many Papers (1:N)
- Cascade delete: Deleting user deletes all their papers
